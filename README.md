<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

RSBox is an Open-Source RSPS inspired by RSMod. There are many differences and improvements as well as an entirely reworked engine. Below are some of the  primary core offers.

Here's What RSBox Offers:
* Streamlined plugin system with Bukkit style API design. The API layer stits on top of the engine so no matter what OSRS revision you use, plugins should not break.
* Drag and drop plugin installation through compiled JAR files.
* No development knowledge needed for server setup. If you just want to run your own RSPS server, we offer download and run solutions to get your server running quickly.

Of course, this is an ongoing long-term project run primaryly by our community on discord. If you are at all interested it playing with RSBox, please join our discord by clicking the discord badge at the top.

A list of core contributions can be found in the acknowledgements section at the bottom.
